-- 1.  What percent survived? (total)

select 
    sum(case when survived = 1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end) / 
    cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv 
    from passengers;
-- 2.  Percentage of females that survived?

select 
    sum(case when sex='female'and survived = 1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end) / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_female_surv 
    from passengers;
-- 3.  Percentage of males that survived? 

select 
    sum(case when sex='male'and survived = 1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end) / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_male_surv 
    from passengers;
-- 4.  How many people total were in First class, Second class, Third, or unknown ?

--first class
select
    sum(case when class='1st'  then 1.0 else 0.0 end) 
    from passengers;
--second class 
select
sum(case when class='2nd' then 1.0 else 0.0 end) 
    from passengers;
--third class
select
sum(case when class='3rd' then 1.0 else 0.0 end) 
    from passengers;
--unknown
 select count(*) as unknowns from passengers where class is NULL;
 
-- 5.  What is the total number of people in First and Second class ?

 select
sum(case when class='1st' or class='2nd'  then 1.0 else 0.0 end) 
    from passengers;

-- 6.  What are the survival percentages of the different classes? (3).
--first

select 
   sum(case when class='1st' and survived = 1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_1stclass 
    from passengers;
--second
select 
   sum(case when class='2nd' and survived =1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_2ndclass 
    from passengers;
--third
select 
   sum(case when class='3rd' and survived =1 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  /

-- 7.  Can you think of other interesting questions about this dataset?
--      I.e., is there anything interesting we can learn from it?  
--      Try to come up with at least two new questions we could ask.

--ANSWER 1. What are the chances to survive in paticular age (lets say from 0 to 15, from 15 to 30, from 30 to 45 etc/
--we can latter create a graph of survival rate in correlation to age )
--       2.What is survival rate of children under 5?
--in order to do the queries we possess all necessary information besides those entries that are blank, but we still can do it with data that is available. We can also do the same queries by age and class together, which would give us a prove that not only passenger's age contributed to fatal outcome, but the fact that people from different classes were treated differently(priority were givento the first class passengers).

select 
   sum(case when age < 5 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_kids 
    from passengers;
select 
   sum(case when age < 15 and age > 5 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_kids 
    from passengers;   
select 
   sum(case when age < 30  and age > 15 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_teens 
    from passengers;
select 
   sum(case when age < 45 and age > 30 then 1.0 else 0.0 end)  / 
        cast(count(*) as float)*100 as tot_pct_surv_kids 
    from passengers;
